# Deep-Learning-Python-Programming

Repo containing some of the custom little projects I am doing to explore and experiment with Machine learning.

#The first sery is the creation of the training data, the building of the model and using the model to classify images of cats and dogs : 

Dogs_Cats_1_Training_Data_Final.py

Dogs_Cats_2_Model_Building_Final.py

Dogs_Cats_3_Use_Model_Final.py

Dogs_Cats_4_Trying_Models_Final.py

Additional explanations can be found here : https://brax.gg/deep-learning-with-tensor-flow-and-keras-cats-and-dogs/

#The second sery is about solving the MNIST problem (recognizing numbers in pictures basically)

MNIST_Model.py

Additional explanations can be found here : https://brax.gg/deep-learning-and-the-infamous-mnist-exercise/

The third sery is about prediction the price of Crypto Currencies based on current prices. 

Additional explanations have to be created

This is based on the work of Sentdex and his great tutorials
